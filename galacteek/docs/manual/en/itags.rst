ITags
=====

*galacteek* extensively uses a custom tags system based
on linked data.

*itags* are separate entities who are required to
declare the meaning of the tag (this is where hashtags
fail). *itags* properties support *i18n* and are therefore
universal.

*it* is the URI scheme that *itags* use. Examples::

    it:ipfs
    it:dapps
